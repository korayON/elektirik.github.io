# AG Electrical Services Website


* A websites I designed and deployed using React for one of my first clients.

* It's fully responsive and features a slider gallery as well as a modal gallery.

* Made use of React Router to keep the UI in sync with the URL. 

* Data files containing info for projects and reviews were created and stored locally so I could map through them easily and add to them if necessary.

* All components are function components which can handle state with useState hook if necessary. Also used useEffect hook with clean-ups to handle side effects.

* Overall, a nice project with lots of components and a bit of interactivity. Made me think carefully about how to structure the site and work with state, particularly for the galleries and the switching between desktop/mobile mode.
